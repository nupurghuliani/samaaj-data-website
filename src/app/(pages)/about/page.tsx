      <section className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-black/90">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-black">Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          Samaaj Data exists to make public data work for the public. We are a community-powered platform that transforms scattered, inaccessible information into insights that citizens and local organizations can act on. By shining a light on the everyday systems that shape our lives — from water and waste to health and housing — we help people push for change in their own neighborhoods.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold text-black">What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          We collect, clean, and connect data from multiple sources: citizen audits, open government datasets, and grassroots efforts. On Samaaj Data, these datasets are not just numbers — they become interactive maps, stories, and dashboards that bring issues to life. Whether it’s mapping tree species, tracking toilets, or visualizing waste collection routes, we translate raw information into knowledge that communities can use.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold text-black">How We Work</h2>
        <p>
          Samaaj Data is collaborative by design.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-black/90">
          <li>Grassroots organizations contribute their on-the-ground knowledge.</li>
          <li>Citizens add local observations that often get overlooked.</li>
          <li>Open government datasets provide a foundation that we make easier to explore, compare, and apply in real life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, we build a shared evidence base that anyone can access and act on. We also work with civic bodies and policymakers, ensuring that community insights inform decisions that affect millions of people.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold text-black">Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Data should not be distant or intimidating. When it is local, accessible, and people-first, it can help identify gaps, hold institutions accountable, and inspire solutions. Samaaj Data is about more than technology — it’s about strengthening democracy by putting knowledge in the hands of those who need it most.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold text-black">Our Belief</h2>
        <p>
          Change doesn’t start in boardrooms — it starts in streets, wards, and neighborhoods. Samaaj Data is built on the belief that small, local insights can add up to big shifts in how we think about our cities and our future.
